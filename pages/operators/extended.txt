
## <a name="classesandmethods">Classes and Methods</a>

The **class** operator defines or extends a class.
If a subclass is specified, presumably a new
class is to be created.  Subsequent expressions 
within the operator may be used to add 
instance methods, class methods, and instance
variables to the class.  

When the **class** operator is used to create a new class,
the class's parent class must be specified after the **is** keyword.

<pre>
(class MyWindowController is NSWindowController
   ...
)
</pre>

When the **class** operator is used to extend a class that has already been defined, you can omit the superclass.

<pre>
(class NSString
  ...
)
</pre>

**imethod** adds an instance method to a class.
It should only be used within a class operator. Return type and argument types may be specified in the method declaration.  The **is** keyword marks the end of the interface definition and the beginning of the method body.  

The following example adds a method to a subclass of NSView:

<pre>
(class NuRocksView is NSView
     ...    
     (imethod (void) drawRect:(NSRect) rect is
     ... ))  
</pre>

Type names must be specified in parentheses.  The types that can be specified are listed in the following table:

<table width="100%">
<tr><td width="20%"></strong>void<strong></td><td> No value.  Use this to specify that a method returns no value.
(void) should never be used as the type of an argument. </td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>id</strong></td><td> An object. The Nu equivalent is an instance of any class. </td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>int</strong></td><td> An integer. The Nu equivalent is an NSNumber. </td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>BOOL</strong></td><td> A boolean. The Nu equivalent is an NSNumber. </td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>double</strong></td><td> A double. The Nu equivalent is an NSNumber. </td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>float</strong></td><td> A float. The Nu equivalent is an NSNumber. </td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>NSRect</strong></td><td> A rectangle. The Nu equivalent is a list of four numbers. </td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>NSPoint</strong></td><td> A point. The Nu equivalent is a list of two numbers. </td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>NSSize</strong></td><td> A size. The Nu equivalent is a list of two numbers. </td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>NSRange</strong></td><td> A range.  The Nu equivalent is a list of two numbers. </td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SEL</strong></td><td> A selector.  The Nu equivalent is a string that corresponds to the selector name.  </td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Class</strong></td><td> A class instance.  Classes may be specified with a symbol that matches the class name. </td></tr>
</table>

See the sample programs for many examples.  If type information is omitted, the Objective-C runtime will be checked for a method with a matching selector.  If found, its method signature will be used.  If there is no
matching selector, the return type and all argument types will
be assumed to be <strong>(id)</strong>.

As a convenience, a dash (<strong>-</strong>) is a synonym for **imethod**.  So if you prefer, you can create instance methods with this simplified syntax:

<pre>
(class NuRocksView is NSView
     ...    
     (- drawRect:rect is
     ... ))  
</pre>

This creates an instance method named drawRect.  The new method uses the signature that is obtained by sending **instanceMethodSignatureForSelector:** to the class being extended.  For more examples of the brief syntax, see the "NuRocks":/nurocks sample program.

When a block is added as a method, it is wrapped in a libffi closure that automatically adds <tt>self</tt> and <tt>super</tt> to the block's context each time it is evaluated.  Method arguments are always evaluated in the calling context before the method block is evaluated.

**cmethod** adds a class method to a class.
It should only be used within a class operator.  Its usage mirrors that of **imethod**.
As a convenience, a plus sign (<strong>+</strong>) is a synonym for **cmethod**.

**ivar** adds typed instance variables to a class.
It should only be used before any instances of the
associated class have been created.  Any number of new instance variables can be specified in a single **ivar** operator.  Each new instance variable is specified by its return type and name.  Here is an example from the "Benwanu":/benwanu sample program:

<pre>
(ivar (id) view 
      (id) progressBar
      (id) imageRep
      (int) offset
      (double) minX
      (double) minY 
      (double) maxX 
      (double) maxY 
      (int) width 
      (int) height)
</pre>

**ivars** adds dynamic instance variables to a class.
This operator should only be used
before any instances of the associated class have been
created.  It adds a hidden ivar to the class that's used to point to an
NSMutableDictionary. From then on, you can add ivars to class
instances whenever you want.  Whenever you set an ivar, If there's no
corresponding one in the runtime, its value will be added to the
dictionary with its name as the key.

**ivar-accessors** adds automatic get and set methods for all instance variables of a class.
These methods are implemented using the 
**handleUnknownMessage:withContext:**
method of **NSObject(Nu)**.

## <a name="exceptionhandling">Exception Handling Operators</a>

**try**  wraps a sequence of statement evaluations in
an exception handler.
Expressions that follow are evaluated
until a list beginning with **catch** is reached.  The
expressions in this list are not evaluated unless an exception
is thrown by the evaluated expressions, in which case,
execution jumps to the code in the catch section.

<pre>
(try 
    (do-something-dangerous)
    (catch (exception)
        (handle-exception exception))
</pre>

**throw** throws an exception. Any object may be thrown as the exception.

<pre>
% (try 
-   (throw 22)
-   (catch (object)
-      (puts object)))
22
</pre>

## <a name="threadcontrol">Thread Control Operators</a>

**synchronized** evaluates a list of expressions after synchronizing
on an object.  The synchronization object is the first argument.

<pre>
(synchronized object
	(task1)
	(task2)
	...)
</pre>

## <a name="system">System Operators</a>

**load** loads a file or bundle. To load a file from a specific bundle, use the following form:

<pre>
(load "bundlename:filename")
</pre>

**system** executes an operating system command.

<pre>
(system "mkdir foo")
</pre>

**puts** writes a string to the console followed by a carriage return. 
**print** writes a string to the console with no carriage return.
Both operators return nil.

<pre>
% (puts "hello")
hello
()
% (progn
-   (print "hello, ")
-   (puts "world"))
hello, world
()
</pre>

**help** returns help text for an object.

<pre> 
% (help do)
This operator is used to create blocks.
For example, the following expression creates a 
block that returns the sum of its two arguments:
(do (x y)
        (+ x y))
</pre>

**version** returns a string describing the current version of Nu.

**beep** causes the system to beep.
