This minor update contains better handling of classes whose init
methods return something other than self, notably NSXMLDocument.
It also changes loading of modules to use a single shared parser
so that assignments made in a loaded file are available in the
calling context (as they should have been).

See the [downloads](/downloads) page.

This build was made from the "amalgamated" branch. Soon this branch
will become "master". As with 2.0, this version of Nu is
exclusively for systems running Mac OS 10.7 or iOS 4.3 and 
their successors.
